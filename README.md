# ðŸš¦ Real-time Traffic Signal Control with YOLOv8 and Arduino

This project implements a real-time traffic signal control system using YOLOv8 for object detection and Arduino for signal control. The system adjusts traffic lights dynamically based on the presence of vehicles and pedestrians.

---

## ðŸ›  Features
- Real-time object detection using YOLOv8.
- Signal control for pedestrians and vehicles with Arduino.
- Adaptive traffic light changes with yellow-light transitions.

---

## ðŸ–¥ Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Arduino with a compatible board (e.g., Uno, Mega).
- `requirements.txt` for required Python libraries:
  - OpenCV for video processing.
  - YOLOv8 for object detection.
  - PySerial for communication with Arduino.

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/traffic-signal-control.git
   cd traffic-signal-control
Create a virtual environment and activate it:
