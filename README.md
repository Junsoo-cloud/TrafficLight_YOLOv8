# 🚦 Real-time Traffic Signal Control with YOLOv8 and Arduino

This project implements a real-time traffic signal control system using YOLOv8 for object detection and Arduino for signal control. The system adjusts traffic lights dynamically based on the presence of vehicles and pedestrians.

---

## 🛠 Features
- Real-time object detection using YOLOv8.
- Signal control for pedestrians and vehicles with Arduino.
- Adaptive traffic light changes with yellow-light transitions.

---

## 🖥 Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Arduino with a compatible board (e.g., Uno, Mega).
- `requirements.txt` for required Python libraries:
  - OpenCV for video processing.
  - YOLOv8 for object detection.
  - PySerial for communication with Arduino.
